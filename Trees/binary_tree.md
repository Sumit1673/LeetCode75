In a binary tree, the values are arranged according to a specific rule. Each node in the tree can have at most two children: a left child and a right child. The rule for arranging values in a binary search tree (a specific type of binary tree) is as follows:

 * All values in the left subtree of a node are less than the value of the node.

 * All values in the right subtree of a node are greater than or equal to the value of the node.

This arrangement ensures that you can efficiently search, insert, and delete values in the tree.

The specific arrangement of values in a binary search tree (BST) offers several benefits that make it a useful data structure for various operations:

1. **Efficient Searching:** The BST arrangement allows for efficient searching. When you want to find a value in the tree, you can start at the root and traverse left or right based on whether the value you're searching for is smaller or larger than the current node. This binary search process eliminates a large portion of the tree at each step, leading to a time complexity of O(log n) for average and best-case scenarios (where n is the number of nodes in the tree).

2. **Ordered Operations:** Because of the ordered arrangement, it's easy to perform operations like finding the smallest or largest element in the tree, finding the successor or predecessor of a given node, and finding all elements within a specific range.

3. **Efficient Insertion and Deletion:** Insertion and deletion operations in a BST can also be efficient when the tree remains balanced. Balanced trees maintain a logarithmic height, which ensures that operations remain close to O(log n) time complexity.

4. **Sorting:** In-order traversal of a binary search tree yields the values in sorted order. This property can be useful when you need to retrieve the elements in a sorted manner without explicitly sorting them.

5. **Hierarchical Structure:** Binary trees provide a hierarchical structure that can be useful in applications like representing hierarchical data (e.g., organizational charts, file systems) and building more complex data structures like heaps.

6. **Memory Efficiency:** Compared to some other data structures, binary search trees can be memory-efficient, as they don't require extra memory for pointers beyond the left and right child.

However, it's important to note that the benefits of a binary search tree are most pronounced when the tree remains balanced. An unbalanced binary tree, where one subtree is much deeper than the other, can degrade performance to the point where it behaves like a linked list for searching, insertion, and deletion, resulting in O(n) worst-case time complexity.

#### Traversal techniques
* Inorder Traversal -> Left node -> root node --> right node
* Preprder Traversal -> root node -> left node -> right node
* Post Order Traversal ->Left node -> right node -> root node

ime complexity of O(log N) is achievable in binary search tree (BST) operations when the tree is balanced. Here's why:

Searching in a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST):

When searching for a value in a balanced binary search tree, you start at the root and make decisions at each level to go left or right based on the comparison of the value you're looking for with the current node's value.

At each level, you effectively reduce the search space by half because you can eliminate one of the two subtrees.
In a perfectly balanced BST, the tree's height is logarithmic with respect to the number of nodes (N).
As a result, the number of nodes you need to visit to search for a value is proportional to the height of the tree, and the height of a balanced BST is O(log N). Therefore, the time complexity for searching in a balanced BST is O(log N).

Insertion and Deletion in a Balanced BST:

Similarly, for insertion and deletion operations in a balanced BST, the process involves searching for the correct position to insert or delete a node. In a balanced tree, the time complexity for these operations is also O(log N) because you traverse a path down the tree that is proportional to the height of the tree
